                    <h1>Our Certificates & Online Programs For 2023</h1>
                    <p>Oxford offers more than 350 graduate courses across the disciplines, with courses opening in new areas every year. This includes taught courses and research courses available for full-time and part-time study, and at every level from diplomas to doctorates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a graduate student you'll belong to a department or faculty – a thriving academic community working to advance knowledge in a particular field. Your department or faculty will provide your teaching and supervision, as well as extensive, specialist resources to support your studies. Our departments often collaborate on joint courses and interdisciplinary research projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every graduate student at Oxford is given an academic supervisor. Throughout your course, you'll receive personalised support and guidance from an expert in your field, helping to guide your programme of study or research.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our courses are shorter than those at other institutions, making them intensive and fast-paced. Some courses are intended to prepare you for a research degree; others are oriented toward specific professional skills. All of our taught programmes are designed to challenge and inspire you, and help you to build transferable skills that are sought after by employers. A full-time taught course typically lasts 9-12 months, but some take two years to complete. We also offer a range of part-time taught degrees. Students on taught programmes study a range of core and optional courses. During your course, your academic supervisor will be on hand to offer advice and support, and to help guide your programme of study. We're proud of the close working relationships between supervisors and students, and the small-group teaching on our taught courses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We have over 120 research courses, including our doctoral programmes. Our research degrees offer the opportunity for sustained research in the area of your choice. Working closely with your supervisor, you will propose, carry out and write up a substantial research project. Your supervisor will help you to devise a programme that allows you to realise the full benefits of the University's outstanding intellectual community and resources. They will meet with you regularly to stimulate your thinking, discuss your ideas, and provide guidance on how to approach your research. Oxford is internationally renowned for the quality of its research (you can read about our research excellence), and graduate research students are integral to our success. We offer first-rate resources and facilities, expert supervision and a supportive academic community in which to work. You'll also receive specialist training in research skills in one of our graduate schools, and have access to a fantastic range of resources and opportunities to help you make the most of your time at Oxford and boost your employability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At Oxford, about 1 in 5 graduate students is studying part time. We offer a wide range of part-time courses, from postgraduate certificates and diplomas to taught master’s degrees and doctoral degrees. These programmes are a flexible way to study for a graduate degree, allowing you to fit your studies around work, family or other commitments. Our part-time courses are designed with the needs of students at different life and career stages in mind. You may be looking to study for a further qualification and enhance your career prospects while in employment, or to develop your knowledge and skills while balancing home-based commitments. Part-time study at Oxford is intensive, challenging and rewarding. Students enjoy all the benefits of an Oxford higher degree, including excellent tuition, supervision and study resources, and are valued members of our graduate community. Teaching formats and patterns of study vary. Read the information on the course page carefully, and if you'd like to discuss the requirements for a specific course, please contact the academic department directly. Part-time students are exempt from the University's residence requirements, but most part-time courses require students to attend face-to-face teaching in Oxford.</p>
